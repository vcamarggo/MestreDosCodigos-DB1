This project is composed of several diferent examples based on the tasks to obtain the badges from the "Mestre dos Códigos" game at DB1 Global Software. At the time of its submission, it got full approval and allowed me to be the first person to obtain the Knight level.

It has several examples implementing PoC of Cache, Dependency Injection, Reactive Pattern, Asymptotic Complexity, etc.

All examples have a small README.md in Portuguese (open a issue if any translation is needed) and a script to run it on Unix, which has been tested on WSL.
